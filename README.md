# MakingThingsMove
From the book "Making things move", I will be mapping the progress of my projects and post some diagrams and stuff on here to help me through my path of making thing Move!

For the first project in the book, I am required to make a goldberg mechanism that breaks and holds the egg's inner components gracefully in 5 steps where each step involves a different machine to transfer / change force direction / speed / magnitude.
  I will contain a link for my learning journey to document and build on my technical know how skills.
